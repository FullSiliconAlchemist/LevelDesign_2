 Prototype number 2: Tele-Parkour
 
 The point of the game is to run through a course, defeat enemies that block your path without losing all of your life, and reach the goal.
 Ennemies are the round red balls, if they touch your character you lose life. Every successful punch you land on the balls is a point, if you punch them off the arena you get 10 points. Reach the goal without losing your life and get the highest score possible!
 
 Your controls are WASD to move, SPACE to jump and L-SHIFT to boost jump and Left-Click to attack.
 
 
 Prototyping questions:
 
 1. Are the controls tight? In other words, do you feel like you are moving the way you intend to?


 2. Are you able to intuitively overcome obstacles and navigate in the game?
 
 
 3. How does the boost jump game mechanic feel or make you feel? Does it work well within the level?


 4. How does punching ennemies off the level feel or make you feel? Does it feel like it is testing your reflexes?


 5. What kind of visual or audio effects would you have liked to see during the gameplay?


 6. Does the objective of the game provide a challenge?

 Prototype number 2: Tele-Parkour
 
 The point of the game is to run through a course, defeat enemies that block your path without losing all of your life, and reach the goal.
 Ennemies are the round red balls, if they touch your character you lose life. Every successful punch you land on the balls is a point, if you punch them off the arena you get 10 points. Reach the goal without losing your life and get the highest score possible!
 
 Your controls are WASD to move, SPACE to jump and L-SHIFT to boost jump and Left-Click to attack.
 
 
 Prototyping questions:
 
 1. Are the controls tight? In other words, do you feel like you are moving the way you intend to?


 2. Are you able to intuitively overcome obstacles and navigate in the game?
 
 
 3. How does the boost jump game mechanic feel or make you feel? Does it work well within the level?


 4. How does punching ennemies off the level feel or make you feel? Does it feel like it is testing your reflexes?


 5. What kind of visual or audio effects would you have liked to see during the gameplay?


 6. Does the objective of the game provide a challenge?

# Design Journal

This game was all about creating a dynamic yet basic movement and fighting system that would entice a player to move around quickly while attacking ferociously. My inspiration for this movement mechanic was Genji from Overwatch, where his abilities include fast movement and dash attacks (also utilized to move around the map) as well as Mirror's Edge a classic parkour game which allows players to freerun accross uniquely designed levels in futuristic environment.

From what I've gathered in my prototyping answers as well as the live prototyping, there were some basic elements that were not yet tweeked properly yet to give the player a proper first-person experience. Often-times, players were not able to understand or make work the camera system, even though it is a basic camera movement system, because the sensitivity was too low. I've also noticed that the mouse would always remain on the screen when the game started which could cause a confusion to the player when moving the camera, as the mouse is moving with it.

Aside from the camera issues, it seemed that the game was seriously lacking in player-driven feedback. In other words, there were no sensual indicators of what was happening or what needed to happen for the player to advance or finish the game. This was ultimately due to the fact that I was trying to build a basic movement and hit mechanic first, however those mechanics quickly became hindered by the fact that the game was not clearly giving player's an understanding of the game flow.

To continue this game, I'd have to implement a sound system, where punching, running, boosting, jumping, all of these actions have some form of programmed reaction for user feedback. I would also implement a more sensitive camera system to avoid difficult navigation. Moreso, I would want to develop the level into something more concrete, IE develop the player's character model, add some ennemy model's and potentially, give the ennemies some AI behaviors.

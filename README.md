 Prototype number 2: Tele-Parkour
 
 Although the level is unfinished, the point of the game is to run through an obstacle course and defeat enemies that will block your path to the goal.
 
 Your controls are WASD to move, SPACE to jump and L-SHIFT to boost jump and Left-Click to attack.
 
 
 Prototyping questions:
 
 1. Are the controls tight? In other words, do you feel like you are moving the way you intend to?


 2. Are you able to intuitively overcome obstacles and navigate in the game?
 
 
 3. How does the boost jump game mechanic feel or make you feel? Does it work well within the level?


 4. How does punching ennemies off the level feel or make you feel? Does it feel like it is testing your reflexes?


 5. What kind of visual or audio effects would you have liked to see during the gameplay?
